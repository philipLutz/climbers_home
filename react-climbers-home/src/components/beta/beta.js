						Situated in a temperate rainforest, the Red River Gorge experiences a diverse range of weather, yet good climbing conditions can be found at any time of the year.  In the middle of winter with frigid temperatures, looming icicles, and snowy trails, south facing cliffs offer a sun-baked climbing oasis.  During the summer months, the overly abundant caves are completely shaded and can feel as cold as your barely air-conditioned commercial climbing gym.  Precipitation is common throughout the year, but fortunately <i>(or unfortunately if you prefer the less than vertical life of a slab climber)</i>, there is so much overhanging terrain that stays dry even in the heaviest rainstorms.  While everyone's tolerance for temperature, humidity, and forced rest days varies, <b>spring</b> and <b>fall</b> are the most reliable and arguably most beautiful times to visit the Red River Gorge.
