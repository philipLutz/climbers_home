						Situated in a temperate rainforest, the Red River Gorge experiences a diverse range of weather, yet good climbing conditions can be found at any time of the year.  In the middle of winter with frigid temperatures, looming icicles, and snowy trails, south facing cliffs offer a sun-baked climbing oasis.  During the summer months, the overly abundant caves are completely shaded and can feel as cold as your barely air-conditioned commercial climbing gym.  Precipitation is common throughout the year, but fortunately <i>(or unfortunately if you prefer the less than vertical life of a slab climber)</i>, there is so much overhanging terrain that stays dry even in the heaviest rainstorms.  While everyone's tolerance for temperature, humidity, and forced rest days varies, <b>spring</b> and <b>fall</b> are the most reliable and arguably most beautiful times to visit the Red River Gorge.

						All the rumors about the endless overhangings of jugs are true, and Corbin Sandstone is an amazing geologic phenomenon.  It is soft enough to be weathered in its wet environment while maintaining strength to form steep cliffs and caves with tons of holds and features.  The sandstone jugs, pinches, and slopers are pleasantly textured, and if you are on the hunt for those elusive bouldery routes, you might encounter some of the most beautiful iron oxide razor crimps.  Because the style is usually straightforward and the holds are generally good, the Red is a great destination for climbers of any ability, and almost every crag has a high concentration of quality routes from <b>5.10</b> to <b>5.13</b>. For the most recent and comprehensive information regarding the thousands of routes hidden in the forests and hollars of Eastern Kentucky, Red River Climbing is the definitive resource.  <i>Bring your best fitness because the pump is real.</i>
